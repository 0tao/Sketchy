			<h1>Dot Matrix Pathing Processor</h1>
			
			The Dot Matrix Pathing Processor is primarily meant to be used for halftone, dithered, and/or stippled drawings where dot size consistency is required.<br/><br/> 
			
			This pathing processor just looks for the next closest pixel to be drawn and lifts and drops the pen for each individual pixel to be drawn<br/><br/>
			
			There are no options for the Dot Matrix Pathing Processor. <br/><br/>
			
			WARNING: This processor should not be used with the Servo Pen Holder as the rapid, repetitive pen lifts can burn out the servo.
