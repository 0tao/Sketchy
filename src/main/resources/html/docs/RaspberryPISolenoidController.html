		<h1>Raspberry PI Solenoid Controller</h1>

		<h3>Left/Right Motor Properties</h3>
		The default values should be correct if you are using a QuickDraw controller board and connected it according to the instructions.  
		<br/><br/>
		Use the "Motor Forward" and "Motor Backward" buttons to test the Left and Right Motors.  
		<br/><br/>
		If the motors are swapped (left/right), then you can either: shutdown and power off the QuickDraw and swap the connectors; or you can swap the pin numbers on this screen, but make sure to swap all pins correctly.
		<br/><br/>
		"Motor Forward" should extend the string, and "Motor Backward" should retract it. 
		<br/><br/>
		If "Motor Forward" retracts instead of extends, you can either: wind the pulleys in the opposite direction; or shutdown and power off the QuickDraw and reverse the connector(s); or you can select/deselect the "Invert Direction" check box for the motor(s).
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h3>Pen Properties</h3>
		The default Pen Pin Number should be correct if you are using a QuickDraw controller board and connected it according to the instructions.
		<br/><br/>
		When calibrating the solenoid, the goal is to use the least amount of power and shortest "Pen Up" time as needed for proper operation.
		<br/><br/>
		Use the "Pen Up", "Pen Down", and "Cycle 5 Times" to test the Solenoid operation. 
		<br/><br/>		
		The next four properties are critical for proper Pen Solenoid Operation
		<br/><br/>
		<b>*** Improper Values can over heat and damage the Solenoid ***</b>
		<br/><br/>
		<b>*** NEVER ALLOW THE SOLENOID TO BE IN THE "PEN UP" (ENERGIZED) POSITION FOR LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF SECONDS!! ***</b>  
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Up Stable Period:</b> The amount of time (in milliseconds) to allow the pen to lift from the drawing surface before moving. 
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Down Stable Period:</b> The amount of time (in milliseconds) to allow the pen to return to the drawing surface before drawing.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Power Level:</b> The initial power level applied to energize the solenoid during the pen lift.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Hold Power Level:</b> The power level applied to the solenoid after the "Up Stable Period".  This is typically around 60% of the "Power Level" as once the pen is lifted, it takes less power to hold it there.
