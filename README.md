Sketchy Drawing Software for QuickDraw (and other hardware)

Sketchy was initially written for the QuickDraw http://www.quickdrawbot.com DrawBot developed by Matt Havlovick and Cory Gano.  Since the start of the initial development, there have been many improvements to the software and it can be extended to be used on a variety of Drawbots or other types of drawing hardware.

If you have purchased a QuickDraw, then this is the software that comes pre-installed on the Raspberry PI.
